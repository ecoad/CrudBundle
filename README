Do your bundles start life with:
* Entity attributes with getters and setters for Id, Title, Body, DateCreated, Author(User), LastModified, Image. 
* Controllers and views that create, read, update and destroy.
* Basic validation
* A service provider class for your bundle, including updating the services.yml

If you answered yes... then stop re-writing everything over and over! Start your bundles life with the CrudBundle
